# GameCockAI Next Session Context

## Project Overview
GameCockAI is a comprehensive financial data analysis platform that downloads, processes, and analyzes data from SEC and CFTC sources. The system features a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline with an AI agent called Raven for natural language querying of financial data.

## Current System Status

### Successfully Implemented Features
- **SEC Form D Processing**: Complete implementation with database schemas for all TSV files (FORMDSUBMISSION, ISSUERS, OFFERING, RECIPIENTS, RELATEDPERSONS, SIGNATURES)
- **SEC Form 13F Processing**: Fully functional with nullable constraint fixes applied
- **SEC N-CEN Processing**: Complete with database schemas and processing logic
- **SEC N-PORT Processing**: Fully implemented and tested with real data (9,117 records processed successfully)
- **CFTC Swap Data**: Processing for Equity, Credit, Commodities, and Interest Rates data
- **AI Agent (Raven)**: Conversational interface for data management and querying
- **Company Watchlist**: Target company management system
- **Database Management**: SQLite backend with export/import capabilities

### Recent Critical Fixes Applied
Based on production experience, the following nullable constraint issues have been resolved:

**Form 13F Tables:**
- `form13f_info_tables.nameofissuer` → nullable=True
- `form13f_info_tables.titleofclass` → nullable=True  
- `form13f_signatures.name` → nullable=True

**N-CEN Tables:**
- `NCENSubmission.submission_type` → nullable=True
- `NCENSubmission.cik` → nullable=True
- `NCENSubmission.report_ending_period` → nullable=True

**N-PORT Tables:**
- `NPORTSubmission.submission_type` → nullable=True
- `NPORTSubmission.cik` → nullable=True
- `NPORTSubmission.registrant_name` → nullable=True
- `NPORTSubmission.report_date` → nullable=True

**Important Note**: These fields can legitimately be missing in SEC data (e.g., "NO 13F SECURITIES TO REPORT", "NA", "/s/ N/A"). Database reset is required after schema changes.

## Data Integration Pattern
When adding new data file types, follow this established pattern:

1. **Inspect Data Headers**: Determine CSV/TSV structure
2. **Document Structure**: Update `datafilestructure.md`
3. **Update Database Schema**: Modify `database.py` with sanitized column names
4. **Update Processor**: Modify `processor.py` with proper data type conversion
5. **Reset Database**: Use "Database Menu" → "Reset Database" (destructive operation)
6. **Process Data**: Ingest new data type

## Remaining Implementation Opportunities
The following data sources are documented but not yet implemented:
- `SecNmfp` - SEC N-MFP forms (Money Market Fund Monthly Report)
- `FOREX` - Foreign Exchange data
- `EDGAR` - SEC EDGAR filings
- `EXCHANGE` - Exchange data
- `INSIDERS` - Insider trading data

## Key Technical Considerations

### Database Schema Design
- Use nullable=True for fields that can legitimately be missing in source data
- Sanitize column names (lowercase, replace spaces/hyphens with underscores)
- Include proper foreign key relationships
- Test with real data to identify constraint issues

### Data Processing
- Always call `sanitize_column_names` function for incoming DataFrames
- Maintain `potential_date_cols` and `potential_numeric_cols` lists for type conversion
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- Handle edge cases like "N/A", empty strings, and malformed data

### Testing Strategy
- Test with real SEC data samples to identify nullable constraint issues
- Verify foreign key relationships work correctly
- Test data type conversions handle edge cases
- Ensure processing can handle large datasets (9,000+ records tested successfully)

## Current Active Document
User was viewing `datafilestructure.md` at line 252, which contains comprehensive documentation of all implemented data structures.

## Next Steps Recommendations
1. Consider implementing remaining SEC data types (N-MFP, EDGAR, etc.)
2. Enhance RAG pipeline with additional query capabilities
3. Add data visualization features
4. Implement automated data refresh scheduling
5. Add data quality validation and reporting features

## Production Readiness
The system is currently production-ready for:
- SEC Form D, 13F, N-CEN, and N-PORT processing
- CFTC swap data analysis
- AI-powered natural language querying
- Company watchlist management
- Database operations and exports

All major nullable constraint issues have been resolved through production testing.
