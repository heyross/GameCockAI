- "Entity ABC Corp: Total swap exposure $5.2B across 23 counterparties. High risk triggers: 2 counterparties approaching downgrade thresholds"
- "ABC Corp and subsidiaries: Combined swap exposure $8.5B (vs. $5.2B reported individually). Missing disclosures in 2 subsidiaries"
- "Total payment obligations: $2.3B over next 12 months. Collateral requirements: $450M initial, $180M variation"
- "Counterparty ABC Corp: Rating downgraded to BBB-, CDS spreads widened 45bps, PD increased to 2.3%"
- "Total derivative exposure: $12.3B, VaR: $180M, 3 counterparties at limit"

**The system is now ready for the next phase: building strategic value features including margin call monitoring, strategy performance analysis, interest rate risk analysis, counterparty credit analysis, and portfolio management dashboards.**
