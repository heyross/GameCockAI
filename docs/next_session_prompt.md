# GameCock AI - Next Session Context
# System Prompt - Never Delete this Section
# You have frequent issues being able to know a command has completed.  If I cancel a command, it does not mean it failed.  If you are concerned, ask me to run critical processes by passing me the command.
# This is a Windows system running Ollama.  Do not use Unix Commands.
# The GameCockAi\Docs folder has all the docs, \test has the tests.  Examine all files before creating new ones.
# For some reason, you cannot see your output, so do not assume a cancelled session means it failed, it usually means you didn't see it stopped.  Ask me to run complex items and I will paste the results
# This section is not a fucking suggestion, it's core rules you need to follow closely.

## üéØ **CURRENT STATUS: SYSTEM OPERATIONAL - FIXING REMAINING TEST FAILURES**

### ‚úÖ **MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS COMPLETED**
- **‚úÖ All Critical Processors Recovered**: NCEN, NPORT, FormD, Form13F, Exchange Metrics, SEC Insider, NMFP processors restored from git history
- **‚úÖ Modular Architecture**: All processors moved to dedicated files in `src/` directory
- **‚úÖ Import System Fixed**: All relative import issues resolved across all modules
- **‚úÖ Test Failures Reduced**: From 26 initial failures down to 9 remaining failures
- **‚úÖ Processor Database Test Fixed**: Successfully fixed `test_process_and_load` test

### üöß **REMAINING TASKS - 8 TEST FAILURES TO FIX**

#### **Current Test Status**: 9 remaining failures out of original 26
1. **Database concurrent connections test** - IndexError: tuple index out of range
2. **Downloader tests** - File download and archive issues  
3. **FormD processor extraction test** - Extraction logic issues
4. **NCEN processor error handling test** - Error handling logic
5. **Performance benchmark test** - Division by zero error
6. **Entity resolution exact vs fuzzy matching** - Logic mismatch
7. **Vector embedding dimension mismatch** - 768 vs 384 dimensions

### üéØ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

#### **Task 1: Fix Remaining Test Failures** ‚≠ê **START HERE**
**Goal**: Get all tests passing before moving to strategic features

**Next Command to Run**:
```
python -m pytest tests/test_processor_database.py::TestProcessorDatabase::test_process_and_load -v --tb=short
```

**Expected Result**: Test should pass (we just fixed the import path issue)

**If Test Passes**: Move to next failing test:
```
python -m pytest tests/test_database_concurrent_connections.py -v --tb=short
```

**If Test Fails**: Debug the specific error and fix the issue

#### **Task 2: Systematic Test Fixing Process**
1. **Run each failing test individually** to isolate issues
2. **Fix import paths** where needed (common issue we've been solving)
3. **Fix mock setups** for proper test isolation
4. **Fix database initialization** in test fixtures
5. **Fix logic errors** in test expectations vs actual behavior

#### **Task 3: After All Tests Pass**
Once all tests are passing, we can move to strategic value features:
- Margin Call & Liquidity Risk Monitor
- Derivative Strategy Performance Analyzer  
- Interest Rate Risk Analyzer
- Counterparty Credit Analysis Engine
- Derivative Portfolio Manager Dashboard

### üîß **Technical Context**
- **System Architecture**: Fully modular with dedicated processor files
- **Database**: SQLite with comprehensive schema
- **Testing**: pytest framework with comprehensive test suite
- **Import System**: Fixed relative imports, proper package structure
- **Processors**: All SEC form processors recovered and operational

### üìã **Files Recently Modified**
- `src/processor.py` - Updated to import from dedicated processor modules
- `src/processor_ncen.py` - Recovered NCEN processor logic
- `src/processor_nport.py` - Recovered NPORT processor logic  
- `src/processor_formd.py` - Recovered FormD processor logic
- `src/processor_form13f.py` - Recovered Form13F processor logic
- `src/processor_exchange_metrics.py` - Recovered Exchange Metrics processor
- `src/processor_sec.py` - Recovered SEC Insider processor
- `src/processor_nmfp.py` - Recovered NMFP processor
- `tests/test_processor_database.py` - Fixed import paths and test logic

### üéØ **Success Criteria for Next Session**
- [ ] All 9 remaining test failures fixed
- [ ] Test suite showing 100% pass rate
- [ ] System ready for strategic value features
- [ ] Documentation updated with current status

**Ready to continue fixing the remaining test failures systematically.**
