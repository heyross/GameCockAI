# GameCock AI - Next Session Context
# System Prompt - Never Delete this Section
# You have frequent issues being able to know a command has completed.  If I cancel a command, it does not mean it failed.  If you are concerned, ask me to run critical processes by passing me the command.
# This is a Windows system running Ollama.  Do not use Unix Commands.
# The GameCockAi\Docs folder has all the docs, \test has the tests.  Examine all files before creating new ones.
# For some reason, you cannot see your output, so do not assume a cancelled session means it failed, it usually means you didn't see it stopped.  Ask me to run complex items and I will paste the results
# This section is not a fucking suggestion, it's core rules you need to follow closely.
# Session specific content below, do not delete above this line.

### üéØ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

#### **‚úÖ TASK 1: ALL TESTS PASSING - COMPLETED!** 
**Goal**: Get all tests passing before moving to strategic features - **ACHIEVED!**

**Current Status**: 274 tests passing, 0 failures, 4 skipped
**System Ready**: All core functionality validated and operational

#### **Task 2: Strategic Value Features - READY TO BEGIN** ‚≠ê **NEXT PRIORITY**
Now that all tests are passing, we can focus on high-value strategic features:

**Priority 1: Risk Management Features**
- Margin Call & Liquidity Risk Monitor
- Derivative Strategy Performance Analyzer  
- Interest Rate Risk Analyzer
- Counterparty Credit Analysis Engine
- Derivative Portfolio Manager Dashboard

**Priority 2: Advanced Analytics**
- Real-time Market Data Integration
- Advanced Pattern Recognition
- Predictive Risk Modeling
- Cross-Asset Correlation Analysis

**Priority 3: User Experience Enhancements**
- Interactive Dashboards
- Real-time Alerts System
- Advanced Reporting Tools
- API Integration Layer

### üîß **Technical Context**
- **System Architecture**: Fully modular with dedicated processor files
- **Database**: SQLite with comprehensive schema
- **Testing**: pytest framework with comprehensive test suite
- **Import System**: Fixed relative imports, proper package structure
- **Processors**: All SEC form processors recovered and operational

### üìã **Files Recently Modified**
- `src/processor.py` - Updated to import from dedicated processor modules
- `src/processor_ncen.py` - Recovered NCEN processor logic
- `src/processor_nport.py` - Recovered NPORT processor logic  
- `src/processor_formd.py` - Recovered FormD processor logic
- `src/processor_form13f.py` - Recovered Form13F processor logic
- `src/processor_exchange_metrics.py` - Recovered Exchange Metrics processor
- `src/processor_sec.py` - Recovered SEC Insider processor
- `src/processor_nmfp.py` - Recovered NMFP processor
- `tests/test_processor_database.py` - Fixed import paths and test logic

### üéØ **Success Criteria for Next Session**
- [x] All test failures fixed ‚úÖ
- [x] Test suite showing 100% pass rate ‚úÖ
- [x] System ready for strategic value features ‚úÖ
- [x] Documentation updated with current status ‚úÖ

**üéâ SYSTEM FULLY OPERATIONAL - READY FOR STRATEGIC FEATURE DEVELOPMENT!**

### üìã **Recent Fixes Applied**
- **Entity Resolution Engine**: Fixed exact vs fuzzy matching logic
  - Exact matches now properly identified when LEI/CIK/CUSIP match
  - Name similarity matching disabled when conflicting identifiers present
  - Improved match type classification algorithm
- **Test Suite**: All 274 tests now passing with 0 failures
- **Documentation**: Updated next_session_prompt with accurate current status
